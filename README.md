# Restaurant Reservations Software

## Description
This application is a reinterpretation of a restaurant reservation management system.
It has the same functions but with a more clean look.
The application allows you to:
1) Register new reservations
2) View reservations for a selected date
3) Mark when customers showed up or not, and modify or delete reservations
4) Sort reservations by various criteria and view the list of all reservations for the day

Software tools used:
1) Vue.js as the JavaScript framework for building the interfaces
2) Plain JavaScript for data management classes and components
3) Tailwind for the CSS of all Vue views
4) Vue Datepicker as a component for selecting date and time when creating or modifying reservations
5) Git (and GitLens VSC plugin) as version control system
